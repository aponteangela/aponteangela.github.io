## Biography <br>
I began my undergraduate career as a mechanical engineering student attending NJIT. I had a passion for learning and building my own projects. I quickly learned that coding was my passion. My favorite project I've created using Arduino and C++ is my punch activated flamethrower. Using an accelerometer, my Arduino Pro Mini sends a signal to a solenoid valve to open and and arc lighter to activate. I am excited to embark on my journey as a Full Stack Developer.
