   <h1> Biography <br> </h1>
     <p1>
My name is Angela Aponte. I grew up just twenty minutes outside of New York City. I began my undergraduate career as a mechanical engineering student attending New Jersey Insitute of Technology. I had a passion for learning and building my own projects. After I graduated college and joined the field of project engineering I realized I wasn't fullfilled. I needed to learn more and fuel my fire of coding. My favorite project I've created using Arduino and C++ is my punch activated flamethrower. Using an accelerometer, my Arduino Pro Mini sends a signal to a solenoid valve to open and and arc lighter to activate. I am excited to embark on my journey as a Full Stack Developer.</p1>
